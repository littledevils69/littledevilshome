        <p>This is a fun group that plays fairly, trades fairly and are active in both the General Expendition(GE) and 
        Guild vs Guild(GVG) battles. We are also very active in helping guildmates raise their Arcs to a high level.</p>

      <h2>Guild rules:</h2>
      <p>Even though we are a fun loving bunch of guildmates we do have a few rules that we expect eveyone to follow.</p>
      <ol style="margin-bottom:0">
        <li>We expect everyone to partipate in the General Expedition each week and to complete at least 32 rounds.  See the FAQ section below for more info on GE.</li>
        <li>When a new Great Building(GB) is placed in the MuD thread it is expected that each guildmate will contribute at least
          1 forge point(FP) to that great building.</li>
        <li>For a particular level of a Great Building this GB can not be placed in both a Swap thread and the 1.9X thread.  For example you can't put a great building in the 1.9thread for the first few places in your GB and then put it in the swap thread for the rest.  See the FAQ below for more info on the Swap thread and the 1.9X Thread.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>It is expected that each week all guildmates will complete at least 32 rounds/encounters in GE.</li>
          <li>Our guild is one to the top teams in GE.  We usually come in 1st most weeks so it is important for everyone
            to participate.</li>
          <li>The calculation for which guild is in the top spots is based on the number of encounters completed by the guild.
            Each person in the guild will complete a certain number of encounters.  If they complete 48 out of 48 encounters
            their personal percentage is 100% completed.  If they do the maximum number of encounts which is 64 they will 
            have a percentage of 64/48 which is 133%.  The guild percentage is the average of all the guildmates percentages. 
            The guild having the highest overall percentage will be in 1st place.
            Therefore, a guildmate in the bronze age the does 64/48 encounters contibutes just as much to the success of the guild
            as someone in the Future age that does 64/48 encounters.</li>
          <li>GE always starts on Tuesday and ends Sunday.  If you don't think that you can play GE in a particular week and
              complete at least 32 encounters, 
            please leave the guild before GE starts on Tuesday.  We will gladly let you rejoin the guild when you can play again.</li>

            The guild has a number of guild thread to help each other out.  Some threads have rules on how they should be used.

            <p>Both the ARC and non-ARC 1.9 threads are available to guildmates to help them level their Great Buildings(GBs).
            Each GB has 5 slots with a different forge point reward for each slot.  Guildmates that contribute to your GB
            are expected to put 1.9 times the reward for each slot. For example if a slot has a reward of 100 forge points(FPs) 
            it is expected that someone contributing for this slot will put 190 fps on it.</p>
            <p>We don't have a limit on how long you take to level your GB, however, please level it as soon as you can so that
            the fps that have been placed on your GB to help you can be returned to their owners.</p>
            <p>Please follow these steps when you want to place your GB on a 1.9 thread.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Before posting your GB on a 1.9 thread ensure that the places (spots) you are asking for have been secured.  A spot is secure when a player can add the appropriate fps to the GB without another player adding more fps that would bump them out of their spot.  You may need to add fps to your GB to ensure that the spots are secure.</li>
                <li>
                    After making sure you have secured the spots you are asking for post your GB along with a message indicating which spots you need filled and how many FPs it will cost to fill those spots. 
                    <p>
                        Note: We recommend using this website: foe-tools.github.io/gb-investment/ 
Choose your GB and the level you are working towards and have put 90 in the % bonus it will generate the text that you can copy and past into the message bar. EXAMPLE: Arc 49 â†’ 50 P1(1482) P2(741) P3(247) P4(67) P5(10) and it will tell you how many you need to have put on to secure each spot you are asking for.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please post the spots and FP values immediately after posting your GB so that guildies know how much to add to you GB for each spot.
                    <p>Note: It is common for GB owners to offer up the 5th position on their GB for cheap BPs when there is no FP rewards.  You can add your GB to the "GBs near leveling thread" to do this.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Guildsmates will then claim the spots you have requested. Guildmates should not claim spots on your GB until they 
                    have been requested by the owner.  Spots need to be claimed before placing fps on the GB to avoid any confusion on who is taking which spot.
                </li>
                <li>Secure or level your GB</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Places must be â€˜securedâ€™ by the GB owner before asking for places to be filled to ensure no sniping can occur. â€˜Securedâ€™ means that the owner has contributed enough FPs to ensure that no one can snipe a spot away from someone who has claimed a spot.</li>
                <li>When using this Thread, the GB must be levelled as quickly as you can once all spots have been filled. We want the FPs to be recycled quickly so that we can raise as many GBs as possible. Remember members taking spots on your GB are only loaning you the FPs and are not making a profit</li>
                <li>The GB owner is responsible for repaying any lost FPs as a result of sniping. UNLESS SPOTS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED FOR are taken OR TAKEN OUT OF ORDERÂ  then the the member taking those spots becomes responsible and then pay for any losses to the owner</li>
                <li>If two (or more) players claim the same spot at the same time, whoever posted first according to the message thread will get the spot. </li>
                <li>The other players will automatically get the next OPEN spots in line based on where they appear in the thread (whoever appears higher on the thread gets priority). </li>
                <li>In order to avoid confusion, the players who are automatically receiving new spots should re-post the correct spot they are receiving (this way someone else doesnâ€™t come along and think the spot is open). </li>
                <li>It is important to clarify who gets what spot BEFORE placing any FPs.</li>
