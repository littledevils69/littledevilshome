        <h1>Welcome to the little devils homepage</h1>
        <p>This is a fun group that plays fairly, trades fairly and are active in both the General Expendition(GE) and 
        Guild vs Guild(GVG) battles. We are also very active in helping guildmates raise their Arcs to a high level.</p>

      <h2>Guild rules:</h2>
      <p>Even though we are a fun loving bunch of guildmates we do have a few rules that we expect eveyone to follow.</p>
      <ol style="margin-bottom:0">
        <li>We expect everyone to partipate in the General Expedition each week and to complete at least 32 rounds.  See the FAQ section below for more info on GE.</li>
        <li>When a new Great Building(GB) is placed in the MuD thread it is expected that each guildmate will contribute at least
          1 forge point(FP) to that great building.</li>
        <li>For a particular level of a Great Building this GB can not be placed in both a Swap thread and the 1.9X thread.  For example you can't put a great building in the 1.9thread for the first few places in your GB and then put it in the swap thread for the rest.  See the FAQ below for more info on the Swap thread and the 1.9X Thread.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>It is expected that each week all guildmates will complete at least 32 rounds/encounters in GE.</li>
          <li>Our guild is one to the top teams in GE.  We usually come in 1st most weeks so it is important for everyone
            to participate.</li>
          <li>The calculation for which guild is in the top spots is based on the number of encounters completed by the guild.
            Each person in the guild will complete a certain number of encounters.  If they complete 48 out of 48 encounters
            their personal percentage is 100% completed.  If they do the maximum number of encounts which is 64 they will 
            have a percentage of 64/48 which is 133%.  The guild percentage is the average of all the guildmates percentages. 
            The guild having the highest overall percentage will be in 1st place.
            Therefore, a guildmate in the bronze age the does 64/48 encounters contibutes just as much to the success of the guild
            as someone in the Future age that does 64/48 encounters.</li>
          <li>GE always starts on Tuesday and ends Sunday.  If you don't think that you can play GE in a particular week and
              complete at least 32 encounters, 
            please leave the guild before GE starts on Tuesday.  We will gladly let you rejoin the guild when you can play again.</li>

            The guild has a number of guild thread to help each other out.  Some threads have rules on how they should be used.

            <p>Both the ARC and non-ARC 1.9 threads are available to guildmates to help them level their Great Buildings(GBs).
            Each GB has 5 slots with a different forge point reward for each slot.  Guildmates that contribute to your GB
            are expected to put 1.9 times the reward for each slot. For example if a slot has a reward of 100 forge points(FPs) 
            it is expected that someone contributing for this slot will put 190 fps on it.</p>
            <p>We don't have a limit on how long you take to level your GB, however, please level it as soon as you can so that
            the fps that have been placed on your GB to help you can be returned to their owners.</p>
            <p>Please follow these steps when you want to place your GB on a 1.9 thread.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Before posting your GB on a 1.9 thread ensure that the places (spots) you are asking for have been secured.  A spot is secure when a player can add the appropriate fps to the GB without another player adding more fps that would bump them out of their spot.  You may need to add fps to your GB to ensure that the spots are secure.</li>
